  <descr> 
    This function converts the closed-loop object to an autonomous
    dynamical system by using the state feedback <i>u = f(x)</i>,
    where <i>f(x)</i> represents the explicit form of the controller.<br/>

    If the system is an LTI system (i.e., <i>x^+ = A x + B u</i>), and
    the controller is defined over a single region (i.e., <i>f(x) =
    Kx+k</i>), this function produces an instance of the
    <tt>LTISystem</tt> class with the dynamic <i>x^+ = (A+BK) x +
    Bk</i>.<br/>
    
    If the system is PWA, or if the controller is defined over
    multiple regions, the <tt>toSystem()</tt> method produces an
    autonomous system as an instance of the <tt>PWASystem</tt>
    class. The number of dynamics is equal to the number of regions,
    over which the controller is defined.<br/>

    In both cases the returned objects represent autonomous systems,
    i.e. their <tt>B</tt> and <tt>D</tt> matrices are empty.<br/>

    Note: this function requires that the closed-loop's controller is
    available in its explicit form.
