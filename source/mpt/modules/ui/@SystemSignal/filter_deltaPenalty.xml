  <descr> 
    This filter penalizes the difference of a signal defined as <i>\Delta s_{k} = s_{k} - s_{k-1} </i>
    where <i>s</i> is the system signal and <i>k</i> is the time instant.    
    The filter is activated by calling <tt>s.with('deltaPenalty')</tt>. <br/>
    
    Any signal can have this filter, e.g. we can without problems
    enable slew-rate constraints on states, outputs, or even on binary
    variables. Non-state signals, however, require that the previous value
    is specified when calling <tt>MPCController/evaluate</tt>, e.g.
    <tt>ctrl.evaluate(x0, 'u.previous')</tt>.
