	<descr>
	  Return true if the union <tt>U</tt> of polyhedra contains overlaps and false otherwise.
      Once this method has been called, the information about the overlaps can be retrieved
      from <tt>U.Internal.Overlaps</tt> property. 
      
      This function considers following two cases to detect overlaps:
      <ol>
          <li> If two full-dimensional polyhedra overlap, then the intersection of these polyhedra
                must be full-dimensional. </li>
          <li> If low-dimensional and full-dimensional polyhedra overlap, then the intersection
                of these polyhedra must not be empty.
          </li>
      </ol>     
        
        <bf>Note that this function is computationally demanding and is suitable for
        unions with small number of polyhedra. </bf>
