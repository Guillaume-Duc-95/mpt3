	<descr>
        Represents a general convex set in <i>\mathbb{R}^{n}</i>. The dimension of the set, i.e. <i>n</i>
        is stored under <tt>Dim</tt> property. The <tt>ConvexSet</tt> cannot be instantiated, you can only 
        create objects derived from this class, see related functions.
        
        You can associate functions to <tt>ConvexSet</tt> class via <tt>addFunction</tt> methods. Function handles
        are stored inside <tt>Func</tt> property.
         
        The <tt>ConvexSet</tt> class handles various methods that operate over convex sets and functions over 
        convex sets. For a list of available methods type "methods('ConvexSet')".
